An attempt to rewrite a [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3) in pure rust. By "rewrite" I mean fully hand-made work, I don't use `c2rust` or any other code translators because if I'd wanted just use working C code I'd use `minimp3-rs` bindings. The goal is to rewrite a library in the Rusty way.   

This work is mostly inspired by 
[rinimp3](https://github.com/icefoxen/rinimp3), I plan to join our efforts when I'll get familiar with the codebase.
